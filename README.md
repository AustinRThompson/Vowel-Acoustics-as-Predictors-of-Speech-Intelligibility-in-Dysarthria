# Vowel-Acoustics-as-Predictors-of-Speech-Intelligibility-in-Dysarthria
This is the data analysis and code for our project "Vowel Acoustics as Predictors of Speech Intelligibility in Dysarthria". In this repository, we provide a clean version of our data set, an Rmd file containing our analysis code, and an Rmd file containing our data prep and cleaning code. All coding was done using R. This work was presented at the 2022 Motor Speech Conference in Charleston, SC and is currently in prep for publication.
